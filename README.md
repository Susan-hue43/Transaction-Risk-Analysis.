## Introduction:
Transaction Risk Analysis involves businesses evaluating their transaction data to pinpoint anomalies or unusual patterns indicative of fraud or regulatory violations. Key risk factors in this analysis often include location, time, and spending patterns. 

This project focuses on analyzing transaction data from Aurora Bank with the primary goals of understanding customer spending behaviors, strengthening fraud detection measures, and support regulatory compliance. By examining various aspects of transaction activity, this analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends that can inform business strategies for both risk mitigation and customer engagement. The resulting insights are intended to provide a solid foundation for more informed decision-making concerning fraud prevention, operational efficiency, and customer relationship management.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this report is to analyze transaction data to identify key patterns and anomalies related to customer spending, geographical trends, transaction errors, high-value transactions, credit risk indicators, and debt levels. This analysis will provide a comprehensive overview of potential risks and opportunities within our transaction ecosystem.

## Focus Areas:
This report will focus on the following key areas of transaction and risk analysis:
- **Spending Patterns:** Evaluating transaction volumes and total spending across different merchant categories (MCC) and locations to understand where and how customers are spending their money.
- **Geographical Trends:** Identifying regions or specific locations with high spending activity or a higher propensity for failed transactions.
- **Error Trends:** Monitoring the occurrence and types of transaction errors, such as incorrect PIN entries, to pinpoint areas for user experience improvement.
- **High-Value Transactions:** Flagging and analyzing unusually high-value transactions to identify potential instances of fraud.
- **Credit Risk:** Identifying customers who may be at an increased risk of default based on their debt-to-income ratios and credit score trends.
- **Debt Levels:** Analyzing the distribution of total debt across the customer portfolio to better understand and manage overall portfolio risk.
