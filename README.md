# Transaction-and-Risk-Analysis.

## Introduction:
This report presents an analysis of Aurora bank transaction data aimed at understanding customer spending behaviors, enhancing fraud detection capabilities, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations. By examining various facets of transaction activity, this analysis seeks to identify patterns and trends that can inform business strategies for risk mitigation and customer engagement. The insights derived from this analysis are intended to provide a foundation for more informed decision-making regarding fraud prevention, operational efficiency, and customer relationship management.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this report is to analyze transaction data to identify key patterns and anomalies related to customer spending, geographical trends, transaction errors, high-value transactions, credit risk indicators, and debt levels. This analysis will provide a comprehensive overview of potential risks and opportunities within our transaction ecosystem.

### Focus Areas:
This report will focus on the following key areas of transaction and risk analysis:
- **Spending Patterns:** Evaluating transaction volumes and total spending across different merchant categories (MCC) and locations to understand where and how customers are spending their money.
- **Geographical Trends:** Identifying regions or specific locations with high spending activity or a higher propensity for failed transactions.
- **Error Trends:** Monitoring the occurrence and types of transaction errors, such as incorrect PIN entries, to pinpoint areas for user experience improvement.
- **High-Value Transactions:** Flagging and analyzing unusually high-value transactions to identify potential instances of fraud.
- **Credit Risk:** Identifying customers who may be at an increased risk of default based on their debt-to-income ratios and credit score trends.
- **Debt Levels:** Analyzing the distribution of total debt across the customer portfolio to better understand and manage overall portfolio risk.

## 1. Spending Patterns
**Key Findings:**

**1. High Transaction Volume, Moderate Spending:** Categories like **Grocery Stores and Supermarkets** (**MCC 5411**) show the highest number of transactions at **18,371**, indicating frequent purchases by our customer base. However, the total spending in this category, at **$501,980.56**, while substantial, is not the highest, suggesting that these are typically smaller, everyday purchases.


**2. Moderate Transaction Volume, High Spending:** Conversely, categories such as **Money Transfer (MCC 4829)** exhibit only **7,257** transactions but the highest overall spending of **$596,560.** This suggests that while these transactions are less frequent, they involve significantly larger amounts of money per transaction (*an **average** of approximately **$82** per transaction*). This pattern could point towards business-related activities or customers sending larger sums of money, perhaps as remittances.


**3. Bulk Purchasing Behavior: Wholesale Clubs (MCC 5300)** also demonstrate high total spending at **$471,078.75**, coupled with a considerable number of transactions at **7,573.** The relatively high **average** amount spent per transaction (*around **$62***) in this category likely reflects customers buying goods in bulk.


**4. Discretionary Spending Trends:** When we look at **dining, Eating Places and Restaurants (MCC 5812)** show **11,673** transactions with a total spend of **$316,035.8**, and **Fast Food Restaurants (MCC 5814)** have **5,888** transactions totaling **$158,989.44.** Interestingly, **Drinking Places (Alcoholic Beverages) (MCC 5813)** have a much lower transaction volume of **2,838** with a total spend of **$67,352.98**, which could be due to various factors such as less frequent visits or regional differences in consumption patterns.


**5. Essential Services Spending:** Categories like **Service Stations (MCC 5541)** with **17,055** transactions and a total spend of **$380,788.89**, and **Tolls and Bridge Fees (MCC 4784)** with **8,242** transactions and **$289,230.09** in spending, consistently show a high number of transactions and significant total spending, highlighting necessary expenditures related to transportation.

**Business Implications**
Based on these spending patterns, the following business implications can be identified:

- **Elevated Fraud Risk in High-Value Transfers:** The high average transaction value in the **Money Transfer (MCC 4829)** category signifies a heightened potential for significant financial losses due to fraudulent activities. Robust monitoring and verification are critical in this area.


- **Opportunity for Targeted Marketing in High-Frequency Retail:** The substantial transaction volume in **Grocery Stores and Supermarkets (MCC 5411)** presents a significant opportunity for targeted marketing efforts aimed at influencing purchasing behavior and increasing customer lifetime value within this large segment.


- **Potential for Business Customer Segmentation:** The high spending observed in **Money Transfer (MCC 4829)** and **Wholesale Clubs (MCC 5300)** indicates the presence of customer segments that may include businesses or organizations with distinct financial needs.


- **Importance of Efficient Transaction Processing for Essential Services:** The high transaction volumes in categories like **Grocery Stores (MCC 5411), Service Stations (MCC 5541), and Tolls and Bridge Fees (MCC 4784)** underscore the critical need for reliable and efficient transaction systems to support these high-frequency, essential services.


- **Possible Data Anomalies or Regional Factors in Low-Volume Categories:** The lower transaction volume in Drinking Places **(Alcoholic Beverages) (MCC 5813)** suggests potential data inconsistencies or the influence of regional regulations or cultural consumption patterns that require further understanding.
