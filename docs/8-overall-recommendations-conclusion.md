## **Overall Recommendations:**

Considering the entirety of the transaction risk analysis conducted, encompassing unusually high-value transactions, debt-to-income ratios, credit score trends (where available in previous turns), and the more recent focus on new merchants, non-chip usage, and critical errors, Aurora Bank should adopt a **holistic and adaptive fraud and credit risk management strategy.** This strategy should integrate insights from all analytical layers to create a more robust and nuanced risk assessment framework. Key recommendations include:

* **Enhanced Integration of Risk Indicators:** Develop a unified risk scoring model that incorporates insights from spending behavior anomalies (statistical outliers and percentile breaches), customer creditworthiness (DTI, credit score trends), and transactional red flags (new merchants, non-chip usage, critical errors). A weighted scoring system should prioritize factors demonstrating the strongest correlation with actual fraud.

  
* **Dynamic Threshold Adjustments:** Implement mechanisms for dynamically adjusting risk thresholds based on evolving fraud patterns, seasonal variations in spending, and macroeconomic factors impacting credit risk. Regularly recalibrating these thresholds will minimize false positives while maintaining sensitivity to emerging threats.

  
* **Proactive Customer Communication and Education:** Engage with customers exhibiting early warning signs of financial distress (e.g., high DTI, declining credit scores, frequent large transactions deviating from their norm) with proactive communication and financial literacy resources. Educate customers on secure transaction practices, particularly regarding chip card usage and awareness of potential fraud schemes involving new merchants.

  
* **Strengthened Verification and Authorization Protocols:** Implement more strict verification and authorization protocols for high-risk transactions identified through the combined analysis, particularly those involving new merchants, non-chip transaction methods, and significant deviations from usual spending behavior. Consider multi-factor authentication and transaction confirmations for these scenarios.

  
* **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback Loop:** Establish a continuous monitoring system that tracks the performance of the integrated risk model and incorporates feedback from fraud investigations and credit risk assessments. This feedback loop will enable ongoing refinement of the detection rules and scoring weights, ensuring the system remains adaptive and effective against evolving threats in the financial landscape.

  
* **Investment in Advanced Analytics and Technology:** Explore and invest in advanced analytics techniques, such as machine learning, to identify more complex fraud patterns and predict credit default with greater accuracy. These technologies can learn from historical data to identify subtle anomalies that rule-based systems might miss.


## **Conclusion:**

We've looked at different ways to find risks in Aurora Bank's transactions, from single unusual events to bigger patterns about how people spend and pay. The key takeaway is that the best way to keep the bank and its customers safe is to have **one smart system that looks at all the clues together.**

By connecting the dots between unusual spending, potential payment problems, and risky transaction types, the bank can get a much clearer picture of where the real dangers are. This will allow them to focus their efforts on the most serious risks, keep customers happy by not causing unnecessary alarms, and ultimately protect everyone's money in the Kenyan financial landscape. The bank needs to be ready to adapt and use the latest technology to stay ahead of new threats.
